  <h1>Join Cardinal Calypso</h1>
    <p>Cardinal Calypso is searching for three talented Stanford students to join our band this school year. If you love music and sunshine and want to be a part of a friendly and exciting student group, we would love for you to try out.</p>
    <p>We'll be holding an informational meeting for anybody interested in joining on <b>Sunday, September 26, 5pm, in Roble theater (inside Roble dorm)</b>. We'll field any questions you have, detail the audition process, and offer you the chance to sign up for a one-on-one audition later in the week. You don't commit to anything by showing up at the meeting-- it's just a way for us to meet people and for you to meet us. Bring your friends!</p>

    <h1>Sweet Details</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>No previous steel drum experience is necessary. Bring your musicianship.</li>
      <li>We meet for four hours a week (tentatively Sundays 6-8pm and Tuesdays 7-9pm).</li>
      <li>We play gigs a few times a month and have a rocking spring show.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Or: Play the Drumset</h1>
    <p>We're also looking for a solid, versatile drummer to become the engine room for our band. The group functions similarly to a jazz combo, and you get free access to our drumset.</p>

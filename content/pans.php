		<h1>The Pans</h1>
		<p>Cardinal Calypso plays the <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelpan'>steelpan</a>, the only acoustic instrument to be invented in the twentieth century. Developed in the 1940s on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, it is a pitched percussion instrument constructed from a 55-gallon oil drum. Traditionally, the steelpan is associated with calypso music, the afro-caribbean style which first evolved as a way of spreading news and free speech under corrupt British rule. Cardinal Calypso promotes this rich culture by playing calypso music in addition to other popular songs.</p>
		<p>We buy most of our instruments from Gill's Pan Shop in Curepe, Trinidad. They are tuned by Joe Kelly of <a href='http://www.californiapercussion.com' target='_blank'>California Percussion</a>.</p>

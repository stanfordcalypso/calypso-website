Hey guys in my 15 min of experience instructing how to solo I have concocted some random exercises that might be total B.S. but they might also work (or at least have a placebo effect). The steps might help (their purpose is just to get you started), but I think the best way to learn how to solo is to go about it your own way. The more you create your own style the less of a box you might be in and the more eclectic your solos will be! It's easy to feel like solos are best when/supposed to be loud, fast, and flashy but don't be afraid to take it slow and make them simple. Also, don't be afraid to "screw up" (especially in practice... practice is for screwing up), the more uninhibited you are the easier it'll be to find creative soloing! <br />
<br />
I hope people have ideas to add and feedback and criticism! for all I know there may be a nice laid out way to think about soloing, this is just my take... <br />
<br />
I'm definitely a fan of recording yourself while going through this process, you can hear yourself, focus on what you like/what you don't like, you can reminisce on it in the future when you become a star pan player (maybe even a silver star...?!!?!). I've already expressed that I think soloing (slash musical improv in general) really helps one's true inner musician come out and has potential to really show how one has progressed/will progress as a musician. In fact, much like the improv class actually helps one adapt to real life, musical improv will help you react to live changes in music (i.e. cell phone ringtones). Soloing definitely doesn't always have to be improvisational though, and improv vs. written will have different benefits (also depending on the person). Either way, you'll discover more about your tendencies and how you think about pan/music. Also, focus on whatever's easiest for you first and then branch out. Understand your own feel for the music before you progress. <br />
<br />
Step 0 – BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE PAN you'll be soloing on. I would say this is an actual step but dbl tenors still make no sense to anyone. i.e. if you were to play a chromatic run on: leads = counterclockwise zigzag. seconds = alternating drum left to right. triple = Left, Center, Right, L, C, R, L, C, R... Even though this is a quasi-step, it kinda takes the longest to get so it's more of an ongoing process. It usually takes a lot of playing to internalize the layout of a pan (or at least the part of the pan you'll need) enough to use those features on the fly. <br />
<br />
Step 1. HIT RANDOM NOTES. Play the song over some speakers or headphones and just hit random notes to it. ANY note. Hit it. Never hesitate in hitting notes (this can be difficult, and I find is quite related to ones personality), if the note is a 'mistake' you won't fix it by hitting it timidly, you'll fix it on the sequence of other notes you place it in. You might find 'unconventional' things that work so don't worry about the 'bad' notes just yet.<br />
<br />
Step 2. FIND THE KEY you're playing in AND THE ROOT - yeah you might think I'd make this step 1, but i don't think there are any wrong notes when soloing, to think that there are is maybe not holistic enough. You can make a 'bad' note sound 'good' with the path and structure of a solo. Once you've found the key and its root, just play up and down the scale to the extent the pan will let you until you're comfortable. Then play to the solo section of the song in said key. The first time you can try it without skipping notes - as in you will move up and down the scale in diatonic order; you can change direction any time but no skipping – this is to help become more familiar with the scale (but you might also recognize other things along the way... Note: this might not sound good, but like I said, the purpose is to get familiar with the scale first). The key (and the root in particular) will be a nice base to come back to if you lose your way; it can act as a nice safe box for soloing within. For leads it's nice because you actually have a border that you'll never cross (it's kinda like splitting the pan on an axis relative to the key - tangent to the 3rd and the 7th for major keys, 2nd and 6th for natural minor). <br />
<br />
Step 3. DIVERSIFY THE RHYTHM! there are tons of ways you can do this. any way to actually get a feel for the song in your whole body (not just limited to wrist and arm movements). 
 - stop playing and get up and dance to the song 
 - whistle or hum a random solo 
 - (don't play) listen to the percussion in the song and think about/feel what it's doing 
 - pick your favorite instrument and listen to it, listen to how it fits in 
 - be an air rockstar! start your own one-person air band. air guitar solo, air drum solo, air sax solo, whatever 
 - look at the music or tabs (this personally wouldn't help me a tab bit, but it might for some) 
 - draw to the music 
 - whatever you can think of 
So to focus on rhythm, play through only on one note, only changing the rhythm. try it again with two notes. then with two notes and their octaves (up and/or down), then 4 notes... <br />
<br />
Step 4. HOW TO MAKE 'BAD' NOTES SOUND 'GOOD'? This is up to you since you're deciding what 'good' is, but here are some ideas on how to keep the flow going even after you play something that sounds a bit off. 
 - you could make a chromatic run out of it to "lead our ears back into the harmonic vocabulary of the song": say you played F# while soloing in C major, maybe you just want to put add at chromatic run back to the root – G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C – or whatever. Of course there are notes in that run that are in the scale so you may not even have to go through all of it to get somewhere that you want to be.
 - you could make a funky minor 2nd chord out of it (F & F#) for a dissonant feel to contrast the 'happy' major sound
 - If you play something that sounds wrong, sometimes repeating it a few times will make it start to sound right. Or at least, it will make the audience think you're purposefully doing it. You can repeat the note by coming back to it frequently, repeating the sequence of notes around it, or including it in following chords
 - If you're particularly theory oriented (… not me), you can figure out "why the note sounds wrong (e.g. where the harmonic tension lies) and truly figure out how to resolve the weird note back into a stable harmony. Sometimes, if you're repeating it like in the previous method, that will buy you time to make this discovery."<br />
<br />
Step 5. SPICE UP YOUR SOLO. Your soloing is probably wonderful already, no lie. If you've done the first 4.0 steps, play confidently, and know how to make anything fit (turning 'bad' notes into 'good' notes), I'm sure your solos are a delight to listen to. There are 3 easy things you can play around with to spice up your solo, make it vibe with the song (or create your own vibe within the song), and/or diversify your style. Dynamics, speed (really note density/average notes per measure... or beat, or unit or whatever), and chords/arpeggios. This time you play through the solo section, do what you normally do but focus on inserting some change in just one of the three components. The first few times you do it just try doing it once each run through, then a couple times and think - in a general manner - about how one instance might affect the other. After going through each while focusing on one at a time, try doing two in one play through the song. 
 - DYNAMICS: people have a tendency to change tempo with dynamics but pay attention not to. practicing rolling notes/chords can be really important for this! 
 - CHORDS AND ARPEGGIOS: might be a good idea to know the chord progression during the section, but it's not necessary. Work with whatever sounds/feels good (I'm sure some people might say it's particularly important, but again, I'm all about anything can work). Chords are easy on leads and 3rds and 5ths are often nice additions! Solos sometimes follow chord progressions, it might be helpful for you figure out the chord progression too, but it's not necessary.
 - SPEED: sometimes slow can equate to simple, but simple can be very nice, and just what a songs needs. Don't always focus on fast. Especially if it's your first time soloing in a group or for a live audience, it can be great to start simple and develop from there (but it's all up to you! You make the decision! Maybe you're all about the blazing speed and ain nothing wrong wit at). <br />
<br />
Step 6A. Sometimes it's cool to LEARN ACTUAL MELODIES OR HARMONIES in a song and use parts of them in a solo. So many songs have the solo be a prominent melody but just revisited in a different voice (i.e. Seven Nation Army or Smells Like Teen Spirit, etc.). Or in the case that you're replacing a solo in a song with your own you can copy clips of what the artist or other artists have done. A little more ambitious - take a clip from another song in the same or compatible key and use it (a la Under the Sea in The Hammer... although I hate to use that example). 
6B. This opens up the spectrum of having the listeners interact with the song. Say the Biebs has a new song and he incorporated a rift from Call me Maybe - people in the know would be like "ha, that's funny because they're both Canadian and people say Carly Rae Jepsen is practically the female Justin Bieber". OR if Kanye were make a song that started a 'Love Story' melody and interrupted it with a phat beat. (... yes i like my sad pop culture references too). One can even get political with this shit. Insert some Al Green in a song about Barack Obama. Artists do it with lyrics all the time; it's arguably even cooler to do it with tones in comparison to words. I'll stop rambling, but this is another form of creativity that comes from soloing.<br /> 
<br />
Step 7. THINK ABOUT HOW THE SONG IS STRUCTURED AND ARRANGED (this could arguable come earlier in the sequence of steps, and step 6 is a manner of doing this). Once you know the song and what its purpose is and its musical effects, decide what you want to do within that, or do to it. Let knowledge of the previous steps help you do that. Maybe starting simple and building with chords later on will be appropriate? Maybe ending will long 16th note runs (high 'note density') will be nice? Maybe you change into a secondary key? Maybe you're solo is all 8th notes? <br />
<br />
Step 8. PRACTICE SOME MORE! Play around some more with random songs. Take certain ideas an themes and work with them. There's a ton more that you can do with solos! Get to know your own sense of music more! <br />
<br />
Hope someone finds this a wee bit useful.<br />
